                                          In order to suit the needs of traders of all preferences and levels of experience, HotForex offers its clients a variety of account types to choose from. You may choose from fixed and floating spreads, commission-free trading (in Micro, Premium and Fixed accounts) or tighter spreads, involving commission fees. Beginners can sign up for Micro accounts with as little as $5, and micro lots are available for trade on all accounts.
                                          Apart from the above mentioned account types, HotForex offers 2 more copy trading ones: an Auto Account, enabling traders to subscribe to free and paid Trading Signals from the MQL5 Community, (built-in to the MT4 trading terminal); and HF Social, which provides trading powered by FxStat.
                                          What is more, swap-free (Islamic) accounts are available with minimum initial deposit $150,
                                           designated for clients who are not willing to earn interest for religious reasons.<br>

                                           In order to open an account with HotForex, traders have to invest a minimum of $5.
                                           Such minimum initial amount is comparatively low, however, many Cyprus-based brokers
                                            require even less. For instance, FXTM and XM demand just $5 from their clients as a start.<br>
                                            <br>

                                            The maximum leverage with HotForex is high, reaching 1:1000. Some jurisdictions cap leverage ratios at considerably lower levels (1:50 in the USA, 1:100 in Poland).
                                            The reason for such leverage limitations is that the higher leverage, the higher the risk of losses,
                                            which may even exceed initial investments. However, many Cyprus-based brokers offer leverage levels,
                                            similar to the ones provided by HotForex (XM â€“ up to 1:888), or even higher â€“ Exness offers leverage
                                             up to 1:2000<br>
                                             <br>

                                          This broker offers a choice of three basic account types: Mini, Classic and ECN accounts. The Mini account is targeted at inexperienced traders, as well as such who do not wish to trade in large volumes. The Classic account is targeted at regular and professional traders and offers full range of tools and trading facilities. As its name suggests, the ECN account is designed for clients who wish to trade in Electronic Communication Network environment, which involves a commission fee.
                                          Another important thing worth mentioning is that the Mini and Classic account offer market and instant execution option. Most traders prefer instant execution, since it allows greater control on slippage and traders are offered requotes, instead of executing the order at the next best price.
                                          Keep in mind that Exness does not provide it services to residents

                                           Most brokers require a certain amount of money to be deposited in order the client to start trading. Exness, however, requires none (for the Mini account).
                                            Cyprus-based XM, for instance, requires a minimum initial deposit, amounting to $5, while FxPro, also CySEC-regulated,
                                             demands $ 500 from its clients.<br>

                                             <br>
EXNESS offers trading with variable spreads, which are attractively low. Average spreads on the commission-free accounts
 amount to 0.9 pips on EUR/USD, while ECN account holders are offered average spreads of 0.4 pips on EUR/USD, however a commission
 amounting to $2.5 per standard lot is charged.<br>
 <br>

You may look up real-time spreads of 15 leading brokers here.<br>
<br>
Leverage
<br>
Leverage levels offered by EXNESS are in line with current ESMA guidelines, up to a maximum of 1:30.

leverage rates are set in many jurisdictions: 1:50 in the USA, 1:25 in Japan, and 1:30 throughout the EU and the EEA.<br>
<br>
Promotions<br>
<br>
EXNESS has partnered with forex rebate web site PayBackFX, and now offers its clients an option to receive cash back for

                                      easyMarkets offers its clients two trading accounts to choose from, available on two platforms â€“ the good old MetaTrader 4 and the brokerâ€™s proprietary web-based platform. Both account types offer commission-free trading, fixed spreads and leverage up to 1:400. Micro lots are available for trade only to Standard account holders.
                                      There are a number of features available solely to VIP account holders, such as Personal Market Analyst, Loyalty Rebates, Express Withdrawals, Free trading signals, Free Breaking news, SMS Alerts, etc.
                                      If you donâ€™t need such extras or simply donâ€™t want to invest 5 thousand bucks, you can get VIP spreads on your Standard account by depositing $250.
                                      Islamic (swap-free) accounts compliant with the Sharia law are also available to clients who
                                      donâ€™t want to earn interest for religious reasons<br>
                                      <br>

                                      <br>
                                      In order to open an account with easyMarkets, one has to deposit at least $100, which is a
                                       reasonable and competitive minimum initial deposit.<br>
                                       <br>
                                      Spreads & Commissions
                                      <br>
                                      This broker offers fixed spreads, which allows traders to predetermine their costs. What is more, no commission fees are charged, as the broker generates revenues through the bid-ask spread paid by traders on each transaction.
                                      Although fixed spreads generally tend to be wider that variable ones, this is not the case with
                                       easyMarkets â€“ their spreads amount to 1 pips on EUR/USD and are accessible with a deposit
                                      of $250. In comparison, Exness and Plus500 (also regulated by CySEC) offer fixed spreads
                                      amounting to 2 pips for this currency pair.<br>

                                      Leverage
                                      <br>
                                      The maximum leverage level offered by this broker is 1:400, which is considered comparatively high,
                                      as CySEC has recently proposed the default leverage provided by brokers to be 1:50. The reason for
                                      such leverage limitations is that higher leverage involves higher risk of heavy losses. Nonetheless,
                                      many Cyprus-based brokers offer high leverage levels: XM â€“ up to 1:888, FXTM â€“ up to 1:500.<br>
                                      <br>
                                      By the time of writing this review, there are two promotions offered (effective until March 31, 2016)

-- First deposit bonus on initial deposit ranging from 30% to 50% (up to $2 000);
