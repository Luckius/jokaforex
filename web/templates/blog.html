                                          are choosing bad brokers to execute trades with them ,

                                          bad partners to go with, if you choose a bad partners like Dealing desk brokers(DD) or market makers(MM)

                                          there many types of brokers some are good some are bad which we coverd in our Training for discount you will pay  $25 for courses
                                          that we will be teaching you on how to escape from bad brokers and other subjects from begginer upto expert level.<br>
                                          <br>
                                          What will happen when you will choose bad brokers to trade with them.
                                          some of bad brokers like Dealing desk brokers they will not take you directly to the real market (liqudity provider)
                                          instead they will make a poll for puting your trades with other trader's trades and hedge the position mean that they
                                          will open a larger postion with high volume against you.in other word they will bet against you
                                          <br>
                                          <br>
                                           imagine you are betting against a person who should be helping you??
                                           imagine you are betting against a person who should excute your trades in the real market?? think about this!
                                           <br>
                                           <br>

                                          , since they
                                          are market maker you can't compete with them they will win even though you in a right position because they
                                          will make manupulation and accumulation to trap you as a retail trader.<br>
                                          <br>
                                          Dealing Desk brokers literally create a market for their clients, meaning they often take the other
                                           side of a clients trade. While you may think that there is a conflict of interest, there really
                                           isnâ€™t. Market makers provide both a sell and buy quote, which means that they are filling both
                                            buy and sell orders of their clients; they are indifferent to the decisions of an individual
                                            trader. Since market makers control the prices at which orders are filled, it also follows
                                            that there is very little risk for them to set FIXED spreads (you will understand why this is! in our courses).
                                            Also, clients of dealing desk brokers do not see the real interbank market rates. Donâ€™t be scared though,
                                             the competition among brokers is so stiff that the rates offered by Dealing Desks brokers are close,
                                              if not the same, to the interbank rates.

                                          <br>
                                          of course some of brokers they are not true ECN/STP brokers (you will learn more about that if you will join our leasson by registering for our courses)
                                          and some are not showing the depth of the market ,some are making slipages and others have high spreads wich is bad idea to trade with them.
